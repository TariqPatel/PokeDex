# PokeDex
An Application that shows a list of Pokemon and their descriptions

MVVM used

I didnt add any unit tests. But I do understand the value of them.
I didnt add any error handling(ui specific) but this is something that I would always add on an application when working.

Overrall I found it was a very cool assessment. The Pokemon theme really made it fun to attempt. Thank you.

All files will say "Created by Tasneem Patel" (I used my wifes Macbook for this assessment).
